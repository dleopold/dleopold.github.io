	abstract = {Ericaceous plants rely on ericoid mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient acquisition. However, the factors that affect the composition and structure of these fungal communities remain largely unknown. Here, we use a 4.1-myr soil chronosequence in Hawaii to test the hypothesis that changes in nutrient availability with soil age determine the diversity and species composition of fungi associated with ericoid roots. We sampled roots of a native Hawaiian plant, Vaccinium calycinum, and used DNA metabarcoding to quantify changes in fungal diversity and species composition. We also used a fertilization experiment at the youngest and oldest sites to assess the importance of nutrient limitation. We found an increase in diversity and a clear pattern of species turnover across the chronosequence, driven largely by putative ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. Fertilization with nitrogen at the youngest site and phosphorus at the oldest site reduced total fungal diversity, suggesting a direct role of nutrient limitation. Our results also reveal the presence of novel fungal species associated with Hawaiian Ericaceae and suggest a greater importance of phosphorus availability for communities of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi than is generally assumed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
