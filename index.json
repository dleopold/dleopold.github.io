However, the factors that affect the composition and structure of fungal communities associated with the roots of ericaceous plants remain largely unknown. Here, we use a 4.1-myr soil chronosequence in Hawaii to test the hypothesis that changes in nutrient availability with soil age determine the diversity and species composition of fungi associated with ericoid roots. We sampled roots of a native Hawaiian plant, *Vaccinium calycinum*, and used DNA metabarcoding to quantify changes in fungal diversity and community composition. We also used a fertilization experiment at the youngest and oldest sites to assess the importance of nutrient limitation. We found an increase in diversity and a clear pattern of species turnover across the chronosequence, driven largely by putative ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. Fertilization with nitrogen at the youngest site and phosphorus at the oldest site reduced fungal diversity, suggesting a direct role of nutrient limitation. Our results also reveal the presence of novel fungal species associated with Hawaiian Ericaceae and suggest a greater importance of phosphorus availability for communities of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi than is generally assumed.","tags":null,"title":"Diversity of putative ericoid mycorrhizal fungi increases with soil age and progressive phosphorus limitation across a 4.1 million-year chronosequence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Devin R Leopold","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

In this explanation, local species interactions are assumed to play a minor role in the formation of the regional species pool, which is instead thought to be driven by speciation and dispersal occurring across larger areas. Here, we provide evidence suggesting a more important role of local species interactions than generally assumed. In an experiment in which we assembled 320 local communities of root-associated fungi under 80 species pools, we varied the species richness of the experimental species pools and the mean age of the sites from which we collected the fungal species across a 4-myr soil chronosequence in Hawaii. We found that realized local species diversity in the assembled communities increased more extensively with increasing species-pool richness when species were from older sites. We also found that older species pools had lower functional and phylogenetic diversity, indicating that the evolution of greater competitive equivalence among potential colonists enabled higher local diversity under older species pools. Our results suggest that the tendency of older regions to have higher local richness arises not simply because older species pools are more speciose, but also because the constituent species have evolved traits that allow them to co-occur more readily in local communities.","tags":null,"title":"Greater local diversity under older species pools may arise from enhanced competitive equivalence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Devin R Leopold","Posy E Busby"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"dc2a60329ebfbbedaad4a445eaf22f59","permalink":"https://dleopold.github.io/publication/leopold-2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T21:26:32.212012Z","relpermalink":"/publication/leopold-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The composition of host-associated microbiomes can have important consequences for host health and fitness. Yet we still lack understanding of many fundamental processes that determine microbiome composition. There is mounting evidence that historical contingency during microbiome assembly may overshadow more deterministic processes, such as the selective filters imposed by host traits. More specifically, species arrival order has been frequently shown to affect microbiome composition, a phenomenon known as priority effects. However, it is less clear whether priority effects during micro- biome assembly are consequential for the host or whether intraspecific variation in host traits can alter the trajectory of microbiome assembly under priority effects. In a greenhouse inoculation experiment using the black cottonwood (*Populus trichocarpa*) foliar microbiome, we manipulated host genotype and the coloniza- tion order of common foliar fungi. We quantified microbiome assembly outcomes using fungal marker gene sequencing and measured susceptibility of the colonized host to a leaf rust pathogen, *Melampsora* √ó *columbiana*. We found that the effect of species arrival order on microbiome composition, and subsequent disease susceptibility, depended on the host genotype. Additionally, we found that microbiome assembly history can affect host disease susceptibility independent of microbiome composition at the time of pathogen exposure, suggesting that the interactive effects of species arrival order and host genotype can decouple community composition and function. Overall, these results highlight the importance of a key process underlying stochas- ticity in microbiome assembly while also revealing which hosts are most likely to experience these effects.","tags":null,"title":"Host Genotype and Colonist Arrival Order Jointly Govern Plant Microbiome Composition and Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edward G.

The composition of foliar fungal communities is variable at spatial scales both small (e.g. individual plants) and large (e.g. continents), yet few studies have attempted to tease apart spatial from climatic factors influencing these communities. Moreover, few studies have sampled in more than 1 year to gauge interannual variation in community structure.\n**Location:** The Pacific Northwest of western North America.\n**Taxon:** Foliar fungi associated with the deciduous tree *Populus trichocarpa*.\n**Methods:** In two consecutive years, we used DNA metabarcoding to characterize foliar fungal communities of *Populus trichocarpa* across its geographic range, which encompasses a sharp climatic transition as it crosses the Cascade Mountain Range. We used multivariate analyses to (a) test for and differentiate spatial and environmental factors affecting community composition and (b) test for temporal variation in community composition across spatial and environmental gradients.\n**Results:** In both study years, we found that foliar fungal community composition varied among sites and between regions (east vs. west of the Cascades). We found that climate explained more variation in community composition than geographic distance, although the majority of variation explained by each was shared. We also found that interannual variation in community composition depended on environmental context: communities located in the dry, eastern portion of the tree's geographic range varied more between study years than those located in the wet, western portion of the tree's range.\n**Main conclusions:** Our results suggest that the environment plays a greater role in structuring foliar fungal communities than dispersal limitation.","tags":["Cascade Mountain Range","fungal leaf endophyte","microbial community structure","plant pathogen"],"title":"Differentiating spatial from environmental effects on foliar fungal communities of Populus trichocarpa","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Habitat isolation and connectivity vary across scales, and understanding how connectivity affects biodiversity can be challenging because the relevant scale depends on the taxa involved. A multiscale analysis can provide insight in biodiversity patterns across spatial scale when information on dispersal ability is not available, in particular for community-level studies focusing on multiple taxa. In this study, we examine the relationship between arthropod diversity, patch area, and connectivity using a multiscale approach. We make use of a natural experiment on Hawai‚Äòi Island, where historic volcanic activity has transformed contiguous native forests to lava matrix and discrete forest patches. This landscape of patches has persisted for 150-yr, and we selected 10,000¬†ha consisting of 863 patches to analyze landscape connectivity using a graph theory approach. We collected arthropod samples from *Metrosideros polymorpha* tree canopies in 34 forest patches during multiple years. We analyzed the relationship of arthropod diversity with area, as well as with connectivity across increasing scales, or dispersal threshold distances. In contrast to well-established ecological theory as well as prior work on birds and fungi in this system, we did not find support for a canonical species‚Äìarea relationship. Next, we calculated connectivity across spatial scales and found lower Shannon diversity with higher connectivity at small scales, but no effect at increased dispersal threshold distances. We examined the landscape structure and found all habitat patches connected into three subnetworks at a 350¬†m threshold distance. All patches were connected at 700¬†m threshold distance, indicating structural dispersal limitation only at small scales. Our findings suggest that canopy arthropods are not dispersal limited at scales shown to impact both soil fungi and birds in this system. Instead, Hawaiian canopy arthropods may perceive the landscape as a connected area where discrete forest patches and the early-successional matrix contribute resources that vary spatially with regard to habitat quality. We argue for the utility of multiscale approaches, and the importance of examining maintenance of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes that persist for hundreds of years.","tags":["Hawai‚Äòi","Metrosideros polymorpha","biodiversity","canopy arthropods","connectivity","fragmented landscapes","graph theory","patch isolation","spatial scale","species‚Äìarea relationship"],"title":"Multiscale analysis of canopy arthropod diversity in a volcanically fragmented landscape","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shawn P Brown","Devin R Leopold","Posy E Busby"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6d0ded8058409bb0ef82394733848181","permalink":"https://dleopold.github.io/publication/brown-2018/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T21:26:32.214298Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brown-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"High-throughput sequencing of taxon-specific loci, or DNA metabarcoding, has become an invaluable tool for investigating the composition of plant-associated fungal communities and for elucidating plant‚Äìfungal interactions.

To test for such influences, we assembled experimental communities of wood-decomposing fungi using a factorial manipulation of fungivore (*Folsomia candida*) presence, nitrogen availability, and fungal assembly history. We found interactive effects of all three factors on fungal species composition and wood decomposition 1 year after the fungi were introduced. The strength of priority effects on community structure was affected primarily by nitrogen availability, whereas the strength of priority effects on decomposition rate was interactively regulated by nitrogen and fungivores.

Using high- Throughput sequencing of two regions of the rRNA gene, we studied the effects of forest area and connectivity on the diversity and composition of fungi associated with the roots of the dominant tree, *Metrosideros polymorpha*, in a lava-fragmented landscape on the Island of Hawaii. We found that local fungal diversity increased with forest area, whereas fungal species composition was correlated with fragment connectivity. Fragment size and connectivity were significant predictors even when we included environmental covariates, which were also associated with fungal diversity and composition. Fungal species composition was more similar among highly connected fragments than among poorly connected ones. We also identified individual taxa that varied in abundance with connectivity. Taken together, our results show that habitat fragmentation can alter microbial diversity and composition via differential response among fungal phyla and individual taxa to habitat connectivity.","tags":null,"title":"Forest area and connectivity influence root-associated fungal communities in a fragmented landscape","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

An increasingly diverse range of fungi are recognized as ericoid symbionts and patterns in the distribution of ericoid taxa are beginning to emerge across scales. However, the true diversity of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi remains unresolved due to limited sampling from some regions and challenges associated with delineating mycorrhizal taxa from the broader fungal community associated with ericoid plants. Interpreting patterns in the diversity and distributions of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi will ultimately require improved understanding of their functional ecology and functional diversity, which is currently limited to a few well studied species. Fortunately, many ericoid taxa are amenable to experimental manipulation and continued ericoid mycorrhizal research promises to improve general understanding of the ecology and evolution of mycorrhizal symbioses.","tags":["[Biogeography","Community assembly","Diversity","Ericoid"],"title":"Ericoid fungal diversity: Challenges and opportunities for mycorrhizal research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.J.

Studies in the New Zealand alpine indicated that early-arriving angiosperm lineages dominated communities via niche pre-emption. Forests have a much longer (\u003e60-myr) evolutionary history in New Zealand than alpine communities (\u003c2-myr) and greater structural complexity. Here we ask whether community effects of arrival order persist in cool temperate forest communities in southern New Zealand that have assembled throughout the Cenozoic. Combining phylogenetically derived clade ages and forest vegetation data from across a mountain range, we compare effects of clade age on relative richness and abundance of two taxonomic groups (pteridophytes and angiosperms) along precipitation gradients. We show that older clades of both groups tended to have greater relative abundance and older angiosperm clades had greater relative richness. Relative richness and abundance also increased with regional clade diversity, independent of clade age. The strength of the clade age effect on community dominance changed differently along precipitation gradients depending on the response and taxonomic group. Clade age had a stronger effect on relative abundance of pteridophytes with increasing elevation and westerliness (i.e. as precipitation increased). In contrast, the effect of clade age on relative abundance of angiosperms decreased with westerliness. Precipitation did not alter the clade age effect on relative richness. Synthesis. We show that evolutionary priority effects persist in communities with a longer evolutionary history than has been investigated to date and across physiologically contrasting taxonomic groups, suggesting priority effects are general drivers of community assembly over macro-evolutionary time-scales. Furthermore, the strength of evolutionary priority effects attenuated along a gradient of decreasing resources, at least for pteridophytes, which improves our ability to predict conditions in which the arrival order of lineages influences community assembly.","tags":["[clade age","community assembly","community dominance"],"title":"Precipitation alters the strength of evolutionary priority effects in forest community assembly of pteridophytes and angiosperms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Devin R Leopold","Andrew J Tanentzap","William G Lee","Peter B Heenan","Tadashi Fukami"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"f5dfdd157e46cd2fc2a9f8d34c08d157","permalink":"https://dleopold.github.io/publication/leopold-2015/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T21:26:32.212583Z","relpermalink":"/publication/leopold-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["abiotic stress","colonization","community assembly","dispersal","gency","historical contin-","immigration history","island diversification","new zealand","niche","pre-emption","stress gradient hypothesis"],"title":"Evolutionary priority effects in New Zealand alpine plants across environmental gradients","type":"publication"}]
